CAPITAL(point)
  actually same as SOLID?
NEUTRAL()
  equally close to two points
SOLID(point)
  solidified distance from a point
TENATIVE(point)
  tenative distance from a point (to know whether it needs to be changed to NEUTRAL)
UNEXPLORED()

for i = 0; true; i++
  for each CAPITAL p
    ns = neighbors at distance i from p // will this work? or will ns get too large eventually
    for each ns n
      switch n.type
      CAPITAL: pass // e.g if two capitals are touching; or will happen b/c ns doesn't have a tracked "frontier"; it's just a diamond
      NEUTRAL: pass
      SOLID: pass
      TENATIVE: n = NEUTRAL
      UNEXPLORED: n = TENATIVE(p)
